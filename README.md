This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Google Earth Demo in Angular

This Google Earth demo is a simple Angular application that integrates Google Earth services to display geographical data, such as polygons, polylines, and points, on a map. The app allows you to interact with the map, visualize shapes, and manage the visibility of these elements based on user actions.

### How it Works:
1. **Google Maps Integration**: The app uses the Google Maps API to display a map.
2. **Polygons, Polylines, and Points**: Different shapes (polygons, polylines, points) can be added to the map, each representing geographical data.
3. **Layer Management**: The visibility of these shapes can be toggled on or off using checkboxes. When a shape is checked, it is shown on the map; if unchecked, it is hidden.
4. **Dynamic Interaction**: The app dynamically updates the map, allowing users to interact with the shapes, hiding or showing them in real time.
5. **Easy Setup**: You can customize the map, add various shapes, and control their visibility with minimal effort by integrating Google Earth features with Angular components.

### How to Use:
- **Installation**: Follow the steps to install Angular and the required Google Maps API key.
- **Customization**: Add your own geographical data (e.g., coordinates for polygons, polylines, and points).
- **Control**: Use the provided checkboxes to show or hide the shapes on the map.

This demo is a great way to start working with Google Maps in Angular, making it easy to visualize and interact with geographic data.
